OPT Comment Data Analysis
=========================

Labeled data is available in `model/` under `train/`, `dev/` and `test/`. File format is <INDEX>-<LABEL>.txt, where a `LABEL` of `Y` indcates support and a label of `N` indicates opposition. Unlabeled data is under `data/`. The `INDEX` should ideally be the same across labeled and unlabeled data but don't rely on it.
